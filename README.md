# MarkdownTest

This repo shows an issue related to the repo MarkdownUI.
I really like the gonzalezreal's repo (check the repo here: [https://github.com/gonzalezreal/MarkdownUI/](https://github.com/gonzalezreal/MarkdownUI/)).

To reproduce the error:

- Run on a iOS 15 device (simulator also works)
- Click on *Show Challenge*
- You will see the markdown and a horrible red rectangle
- Tap and drag your finger on that horrible red rectangle
- The Markdown should disappear

This video shows it:
